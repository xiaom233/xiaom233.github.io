Recent advances in single image super-resolution (SISR)
have achieved extraordinary performance, but the computational cost is too heavy to apply in edge devices.
To alleviate this problem, many novel and effective solutions have
been proposed. Convolutional neural network (CNN) with
the attention mechanism has attracted increasing attention due to its efficiency and effectiveness. However, there
is still redundancy in the convolution operation. In this
paper, we propose Blueprint Separable Residual Network
(BSRN) containing two efficient designs. One is the usage
of blueprint separable convolution (BSConv), which takes
place of the redundant convolution operation. The other
is to enhance the model ability by introducing more effective attention modules. The experimental results show that
BSRN achieves state-of-the-art performance among existing efficient SR methods. Moreover, a smaller variant of our
model BSRN-S won the first place in model complexity track
of NTIRE 2022 Efficient SR Challenge.
