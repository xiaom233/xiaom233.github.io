Biography
======
Currently, I am a Ph.D. student supervised by [Prof. ZHOU Jiantao](https://www.fst.um.edu.mo/people/jtzhou/) at University of Macau.
I worked as a research assistant supervised [Prof. DONG Chao ](http://xpixel.group/2010/01/20/chaodong.html) in **[XPixel Group](http://xpixel.group/index.html) in Multimedia Laboratory@SIAT-CAS** (2022-2024).
I received a Bachelor degree in Software Engineering at 
[Northwestern Polytechnical University](https://en.nwpu.edu.cn/).
I also work closely with [Dr. GU Jinjin](https://www.jasongt.com/) and
Ph.D. candidate [CHEN Xiangyu](https://chxy95.github.io/).  

My research interests focus on **Deep Learning** and **Computer Vision**, especially in:  
+ **Image Restoration and Enhancement** : To propose high-performance methods to 
  process degraded images.
