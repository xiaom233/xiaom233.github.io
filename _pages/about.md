Biography
======
**Looking for 2023 PhD position**  
I currently work as a research assistant in **[XPixel Group](http://xpixel.group/index.html) in Multimedia Laboratory@SIAT-CAS**.
I received a Bachelor degree in Software Engineering at 
[Northwestern Polytechnical University](https://en.nwpu.edu.cn/).
I am supervised by [Prof. Yu Qiao](http://mmlab.siat.ac.cn/yuqiao)
and [Prof. Chao Dong](http://xpixel.group/2010/01/20/chaodong.html).
I also work closely with Ph.D. candidate [Xiangyu Chen](https://chxy95.github.io/).  

My research interests focus on **Deep Learning** and **Computer Vision**, especially in:  
+ **Image Super-Resolution** : Try to design a high-performance Image Restoration or Enhancement methods to 
  process degraded images.
